The shortage of physical lab models in university control engineering laboratories is a widely recognised problem at the international level. In response to this challenge, this paper presents CE2Labs (Unlocking the Development and Experiences of Control Education Labs), a teaching innovation project funded by the IFAC Activity Fund and developed by an international team of educators and laboratory engineers from universities in Spain, Sweden, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The project proposes the design and construction of low-cost, open-source physical lab models at different levels of complexity, ranging from 3D-printed mechanical devices to Arduino-based and custom electronics solutions, as well as the development of an open-access web platform where educators worldwide can access the materials and share experiences.

## Ce2Lab - Watt Governor

This repository contains the STL files required to build a simple **Watt Governor demonstrator** for educational use. The objective of the model is to provide a **visual and intuitive demonstration** of how a centrifugal governor works. By rotating the central shaft manually, the user can observe how the rotating masses move outward as the rotational speed increases, causing the central collar to move vertically.

Go to [official site](Watt%20Governor/) for full details on the complete project.

## Ce2Lab - Ball and Beam

The Ball and Beam system is a classic experiment widely used in control engineering to study PID control techniques. The objective of the system is to maintain a ball at a desired position along a beam by adjusting the beam's angle. This is achieved by continuously measuring the ball position and applying a PID control action to a servo motor that tilts the beam.

Go to [official site](Ball%20and%20Beam/) for full details on the complete project.

## Ce2Lab - Scape Box

The repository contains the STL files and source code for the Scape Box. This information can also be found in the following articles [paper1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896324020500) [paper 2](https://riunet.upv.es/entities/publication/dc21669b-1198-4ed1-a857-8e3008be40ff).
